# Data Preparation
- [X] fuse datasets with additional feature (type)
- [X] summary statistics
- [X] data cleaning if necessary
- [?] data validation
- [X] split data into train and test + validation

# Modeling
- [X] regression model
- [X] classification model

# Tuning
- [X] add features one by one and evaluate
- [X] add non-linear features
- [X] remove correlated features
- [ ] binning
- [x] tune hyper parameters
